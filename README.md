# FaceMaskDetection 

This project aims to develop a face mask detection system that uses computer vision techniques to identify individuals who are not wearing face masks in public places. The system is designed to analyze live video feed from CCTV cameras and identify individuals without face masks. The system uses deep learning algorithms to detect faces

The system aims to help enforce face mask policies and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. The purpose of a face mask detection project is to contribute to public health efforts to control the spread of infectious diseases and protect individuals in public spaces.

# Precodure

There are 4 steps for building FaceMask detection model

## Face Identification
## Face Extraction
## Feature Extraction
## Training Model

we used Retina Face for detecting and extracting Face and CNN model for feature extraction and detection of face mask

# Accuracy
Model gives a accuracy of 93%
Accuracy of Retina-Face to detect faces 99%
Overall accuracy 92.07%

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the project was able to successfully classify face masks in images with a high degree of
accuracy. The findings of the project demonstrate the potential of machine learning and deep learning in
particular, to be used in real-world scenarios to improve decision-making processes and increase
efficiency. 

The success of the project can be attributed to the effective use of the selected machine learning algorithms, model architecture, and the data preprocessing pipeline. The literature review played a critical role in
guiding the project, identifying the most appropriate methods, and ensuring the project was using the
most up-to-date and effective technologies available.

# Future Scope

More than 70 countries have adopted laws requiring that masks must be worn at all official places on the planet. You must cover your face at school, supermarket, bus stop, office, shop and everywhere else in public where you want to go. In order to measure the overall number of customers visited in a shop, software is often used by retailers. To that end, we propose updating our mask detection system and announcing it as an open source project. 

In order to enable the operator to know whether users are not wearing masks and if warnings can be lost, it is possible to add a real video mask detection function in web or desktop applications. Images should be transmitted to software operators if any person does not wear a mask. Besides, if anyone comes within the perimeter without a mask, we're going to be able to install an alarm system that will beep. This software, which can be linked to the entry gates, is only capable of being used by people wearing face masks. The hospital gates, schools, malls and other public areas would be connected to this
system.
